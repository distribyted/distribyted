## About The Project

![Distribyted Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

Distribyted is an alternative torrent client. 
It can expose torrent files as a standard FUSE, webDAV or HTTP endpoint and download them on demand, allowing random reads using a fixed amount of disk space. 

Distribyted tries to make easier integrations with other applications using torrent files, presenting them as a standard filesystem. 

**Note that distribyted is in beta version, it is a proof of concept with a lot of bugs.**

## Use Cases

- Play **multimedia files** on your favorite video or audio player. These files will be downloaded on demand and only the needed parts.
- Explore TBs of data from public **datasets** only downloading the parts you need. Use **Jupyter Notebooks** directly to process or analyze this data.
- Share your latest dataset creation just sharing a magnet link. People will start access your data in seconds.
- Play your **ROM backups** directly from the torrent file. You can have virtually GBs in games and only downloaded the needed ones.

## Documentation

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

Some areas need more care than others:
- Windows and macOS tests and compatibility. I don't have any easy way to test distribyted on these operating systems.
- Web interface. Web development is not my _forte_.
- Tutorials. Share with the community your use case!
